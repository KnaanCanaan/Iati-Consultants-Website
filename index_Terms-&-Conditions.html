        <h2>Terms & Conditions of Engagement | Last Updated: 15/01/2026</h2>
        <h3>1. Parties & Agreement</h3>
        <p>This agreement is between Iati Consultants ("the Consultant", "we", "us", "our"), with its principal place of business in New Zealand, and the client as named in the accompanying Proposal or Engagement Letter ("the Client", "you", "your"). These Terms and Conditions, together with the signed Proposal/Engagement Letter, form the entire agreement ("the Agreement").</p>

        <h3>2. Services</h3>
        <p>The Consultant will provide political strategy, policy analysis, government relations, communications advice, and related services as detailed in the specific Proposal ("the Services"). The scope of Services is limited to what is explicitly described. Any significant changes must be agreed in writing.</p>

        <h3>3. Client Responsibilities</h3>
        <p>You agree to:</p>
        <p class="text-indent">a) Provide timely, accurate, and complete information necessary for us to perform the Services.</p>
        <p class="text-indent">b) Appoint a single point of contact for decisions and communication.</p>
        <p class="text-indent">c) Secure any necessary internal approvals for the provision of information or implementation of advice.</p>
        <p class="text-indent">d) Comply with all relevant laws, including the Electoral Act 1993, Local Electoral Act 2001, and any relevant rules set by the Parliamentary Service or Registrar of Parliamentary Electorates.</p>

        <p class="text-indent">b) This obligation does not apply to information that is publicly available, independently developed, or required to be disclosed by law (e.g., to the New Zealand Electoral Commission or under the Official Information Act 1982).</p>
        <p class="text-indent">c) Given the sensitive nature of political work, we will exercise utmost discretion, but you acknowledge that absolute confidentiality in political environments cannot be guaranteed.</p>
        <p class="text-indent">•	Principle 5: We take reasonable steps to protect your information from loss, misuse, or disclosure</p>

        <p class="text-indent">b) Our advice is based on professional expertise. We do not guarantee any specific electoral or political outcome.</p>
        <p class="text-indent">c) It is the Client’s ultimate responsibility to ensure compliance with all campaign finance, election advertising, lobbying, and disclosure laws. While we may advise on compliance, we are not your legal counsel.</p>

        <p class="text-indent">c) All fees are in New Zealand Dollars (NZD) and are exclusive of GST. You must pay the GST amount where applicable.</p>
        <p class="text-indent">d) We may charge reasonable expenses (travel, accommodation, third-party costs) incurred with your prior approval.</p>
        <p class="text-indent">e) Late payments may incur interest at a rate of 2% per month on the overdue amount.</p>

        <h3>7. Intellectual Property</h3>
        <p class="text-indent">a) Any reports, strategies, plans, or materials created specifically for you ("Deliverables") will be your property upon full payment of all fees.</p>
        <p class="text-indent">b) The Consultant retains ownership of all pre-existing methodologies, tools, templates, and general know-how ("Background IP") used in providing the Services.</p>

        <h3>9. Limitation of Liability</h3>
        <p class="text-indent">a) To the maximum extent permitted by the New Zealand Consumer Guarantees Act 1993 and the Contract and Commercial Law Act 2017, our total liability to you for any loss or damage is limited to the total fees paid by you under this Agreement in the six months prior to the event giving rise to the claim.</p>
        <p class="text-indent">b) We shall not be liable for any indirect, consequential, or incidental damages (including loss of profit, reputation, or opportunity), regardless of cause.</p>
        <p class="text-indent">c) These limitations do not apply to liability for personal injury, fraud, or wilful misconduct.</p>

        <h3>10. Conflicts of Interest</h3>
        <p>We strive to avoid conflicts of interest. If we become aware of a conflict (e.g., engagement with another party on a directly competing issue), we will promptly notify you and discuss the appropriate steps, which may include terminating this Agreement.</p>

        <h3>11. Publicity</h3>
        <p>You agree not to use the name "Iati Consultants" or imply our endorsement in any public announcement, promotional material, or political advertisement without our prior written consent.</p>

        <h3>12. Governing Law</h3>
        <p>This Agreement is governed by the laws of New Zealand. Both parties submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of New Zealand.</p>

        <h3>13. General</h3>
